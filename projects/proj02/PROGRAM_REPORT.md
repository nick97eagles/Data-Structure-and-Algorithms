### Final Write Up 
This program was fun to implement even though it had some challenges.  
The opened ended idea of this project let me and the guys I was working with come up  
with some fun ideas we thought would be cool. Of course not all of them were added to  
the program but the editing function of the applications was and that was probably the  
hardest of them all to implement. Besides that portion of the program everything else  
wasn't to hard to write, it just took time. 

Writing the tests for the program before the actual program was written was challenging. 
I wasn't quite sure what tests I would need at first to get 100% coverage of my code. I think
in the end I was able to get about 95% of the code covered, but the edit function was thought
of later and therefore does not have a test for it that would cover it all.
